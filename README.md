# When Fate Says No

An interactive narrative about a girl who wants to die. The problem? The universe has other plans. Each of her attempts fails in absurd and unexpected ways. Decide her path and discover what happens when fate simply refuses to let go.

## Concept

    "When Fate Says No‚Äù is a text-based adventure game that runs entirely in the console."
    "The focus is on the story and the consequences of the player's decisions."
    "The game world changes based on the player's actions."

## Features

* **Branching narrative:** Every decision leads to new paths and consequences.
* **Dynamic state system:** An invisible `hopeLevel` tracks the protagonist's emotional state and changes the atmosphere of the game.
* **Persistent world:** Actions such as injuries or blocking paths have lasting effects on the available options.
* **Persistent diary:** Diary entries written by the player are saved in a `diary.txt` file and are retained between game sessions.
