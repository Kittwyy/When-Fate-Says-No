            // --- Phase 1: The Slow Fade - Erinnerungen an eine frühere Zeit ---

            "March 5th.\nFound a dried flower pressed between the pages of an old book. I don't remember putting it there. A tiny, colorful ghost.",
            
            "March 20th.\nThe town has two smells: wet pavement after it rains, and the faint, sweet smell from the biscuit factory on weekdays. Both smell like nostalgia for a life I never really had.",

            "April 14th.\nFound my old sketchbook. The pages are full of birds. I used to spend hours at the window, just drawing them. Now... I just watch them fly away.",

            "April 22nd.\nDad taught me how to skip stones at the Pond. He always found the perfect flat ones. I went there today. All the stones felt wrong.",

            // --- Phase 2: Ghosts of the Past - Beziehungen und Isolation ---

            "April 28th.\nMom called. Again. Same questions. 'Are you eating?', 'Have you been outside?'. She never asks the real questions. Maybe she's afraid of the answer.",

            "May 4th.\nGot a postcard from Sarah today. She's in a city with millions of people, talking about concerts and crowds. I'm in a town of a few thousand, and I've never felt more alone. I put the postcard in a drawer.",
            
            "May 19th.\nIt rained today. The kind of rain that makes you think of the old bridge, and the promises we carved into the railing when we were kids. The wood is probably rotten by now. Like the promises.",

            "May 25th.\nThe 10:14 train used to be my favorite sound. The whistle meant a possibility. Now it's just a reminder. The one time I needed it to be on time, for Dad's funeral... 'Signal failure', they said. It feels like my whole life is one long signal failure.",

            // --- Phase 3: The Detachment - Die Welt von außen beobachten ---

            "June 1st.\nI tried to read a book from the library. The words just arranged themselves into patterns on the page. They didn't mean anything. The silence in there was louder than the silence in my room.",

            "June 7th.\nSaw Mrs. Gable next door watering her plastic flowers again. We're not so different, her and I. Tending to something that will never grow, pretending it's alive.",

            "June 12th.\nWatched the kids from the elementary school play in the park. They shout and run without thinking. When did we learn to think before we run? When did we learn to stop running altogether?",
            
            "June 18th.\nSometimes I think I'm a ghost, and the world is just polite enough not to mention it. Things move out of my way. The glass I almost knock over steadies itself. The bus I'm running for is always a minute late. It's a very considerate haunting.",

            // --- Phase 4: Final Thoughts - Die Zeit vor dem Spielstart ---

            "June 21st.\nI looked in the mirror today and for a second, I didn't recognize myself. It wasn't scary. It was just... quiet. Like looking at a photograph of a stranger.",

            "June 24th.\nThey say time heals all wounds. They're wrong. Time is the wound. It's a long, slow bleed that never stops.",

            "June 26th.\nI cleaned my room today. Put everything in its place. A tidy little museum of a life that's already over. All that's left is to turn off the lights.",
            
            "June 28th.\nI think I'm done writing. What's the point of logging the decay? It's like taking notes on a shipwreck... while you're still on board."
